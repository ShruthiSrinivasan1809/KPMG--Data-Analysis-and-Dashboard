# KPMG--Data-Analysis-and-Dashboard
This project is done as a virtual internship for KPMG. This involved performing data analysis, customer segmentation and Building a dashboard.
This project is implemented using Power BI. 

Task 1: 
It involves identifying unsuitable data and fields on the datasets provided by the company SPROCKET DIGITAL. Suggestions were made to the client to improve their datasets, which can then be used for clear-cut customer segmentation. 

Task2:

This involved clearing the datasets and combining them together into meaningful data. With the help of Power BI, the datasets are combined into meaningful format which can then be used for analysis and visualization. 

RFM( Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis is performed to obtain the different customer segments and identify high-value customers. Desirable field-level modifications were made to this overall dataset. Client-understandable visualizations were made that act as findings containing high-value customers whom the company has to target. This is conveyed in the format of PPT which is the submission document for this task. 

Additionally, using the Python feature in Power BI, a document called "Encoded and imputed overall combined data" is obtained by performing necessary imputations and encoding to make the data best suitable to be used for prediction using classification-ML techniques. Decision Tree and random-forest( ensemble method) are best suited if this task has to be taken forward for future classification as valuable/not valuable. However, we stand at an analysis point of view and made use of the market concept RFM analysis that has worked out the best. 

Task3: 

Involves the creation of a Dashboard that depicts the real-time alterations made in the dataset. Power BI has helped to build an interactive dashboard that can provide insights and customer behavior in a real-time environment. This can help the company to make informed decisions about customer trends and act accordingly to sustain the business. Submission is made in the form of a PPT. Additionally, PowerBI's Q&A facility is used to deliver the insights in the question.
